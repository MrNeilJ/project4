 * Description: This is a header file for the function
 * called hailstone.  This function takes in a positive
 * integer as the parameter.  If the integer is positive
 * it will be divided by two, if the integer is negative it
 * will be multiplied by 3 and plus 1.  The program will go
 * step by step until the value is 1. It will then return
 * the amount of steps it took to get to 1.
 * EX. 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 = 7 steps
